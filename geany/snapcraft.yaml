summary: A fast and lightweight IDE using GTK+ snap
description: "Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment. It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a few dependencies from other packages. It is using only the GTK2 toolkit and therefore you need only the GTK2 runtime libraries to run Geany.

The basic features of Geany are: - syntax highlighting - code completion - auto completion of constructs like if, for and while, XML and HTML - call tips - folding - many supported filetypes like C, Java, PHP, HTML, Python, Perl, Pascal - symbol lists - embedded terminal emulation"
