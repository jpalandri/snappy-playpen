# $PROJECT snap

This project creates a working snap of $PROJECT.

To get this done, we need to do the following:
 - add custom launcher
 - build from current git
 - etc.

## Current state

Working features:
 - it builds and runs in --devmode

Known issues:
  - ...

TODO:
 - get rid of devmode
 - build wrapper
 - build the deps too?
 - build geany-plugins? the same snap or another?
